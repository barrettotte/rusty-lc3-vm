# rusty-lc3-vm

A simple LC3 VM to practice Rust. 
This definitely isn't great, I need to get a better feel for this.

The [Little Computer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) is a fictional computer
used to teach students about assembly language. 

## Run

`cargo run -- test_img/2048.obj`
